Hi 

I'm Timothy Ohimah Emmanuel from Nigeria, and I focus on web development. I have a strong passion for learning languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I love getting involved in different projects. Alongside coding, I also enjoy writing BSc projects, where I can dive deep into complex topics and express my ideas clearly.
